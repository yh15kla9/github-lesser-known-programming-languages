- [Quorum](https://github.com/qorf/quorum-language) - Quorum is a general purpose programming language designed for several purposes. First, we regularly run experiments with people at various age and experience ranges, investigating ways to make the language easier to use. Evidence gathered from these studies is filtered back into the design, making quorum an "evidence-based" programming language. Second, as our team is interested in issues of equity for all people, perhaps especially people with disabilities, we are careful to design libraries that are friendly to the broad population. This means many internal libraries in the language have support for accessibility.
# R:

The focus is on administrative and experimental programming, but it has enhanced benefits like Multithreading, CGI, Web functions and native function calling. The most buildin functions are compatible with PHP, for example fopen().
# W:
# X:
# Y:
- [Yorick](https://software.llnl.gov/yorick-doc/) - Yorick is an interpreted programming language for scientific simulations or calculations, postprocessing or steering large simulation codes, interactive scientific graphics, and reading, writing, or translating large files of numbers. 
- [Yuescript](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript) - Yuescript is a Moonscript dialect. It is derived from Moonscript language 0.5.0 and continuously adopting new features to be more up to date. Moonscript is a language that compiles to Lua. Since original Moonscript has been used to write web framework lapis and run a few business web sites like itch.io and streak.club with some large code bases. The original language is getting too hard to adopt new features for those may break the stablility for existing applications.
# Z:
- [Zephir](https://github.com/zephir-lang/zephir) - Zephir - is a high level programming language that eases the creation and maintainability of extensions for PHP. Zephir extensions are exported to C code that can be compiled and optimized by major C compilers such as gcc/clang/vc++. Functionality is exposed to the PHP language.
