  - ⛓ Automatic IO concurrency and parallelism across events and arrays - Alan exploits opportunities for IO concurrency or CPU parallelization across machines in a cluster via arrays and a static event loop without threads, channels, promises, futures, locks, etc;
  - ✅ Almost no runtime errors - No deadlocks, livelocks, undefined variables, divide-by-zero, integer under/overflow, array out-of-bounds access, etc;
  - ⚡️ No GC pauses - Alan’s runtime manages memory allocation, access, and deallocation for you like Java, Python, or Javascript. However, Alan’s static event system and automatic event-oriented memory model does so without garbage collector pauses.
